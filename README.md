# CE7454 Deep Learning for Data Science

**Instructor:** [Xavier Bresson](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/xbresson/)

## Course Description:

Deep learning has recently introduced a paradigm shift from human-design features to end-to-end systems, and has revolutionized several fields including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Top IT companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon have been actively redesigned their products with deep learning techniques, and the impacts in the coming decades will go beyond self-driving cars, strategic games like Go, and MRI cancer detection.

The main objective of this course is to introduce the mathematical foundations, the state-of-the-art architectures, and the professional libraries of deep learning architectures. Students will learn how to design their own artificial neural network to solve their data analysis task. They will also learn how to code efficiently these new algorithms using TensorFlow and PyTorch.
